        The best way to end a day in paradise, is to have a delicious dinner. A
        local Balashi beer in your hand, a beautiful sunset in the background..
        Do I need to say more? Personally I love to eat at local venues. Below I
        have listed my favorites.

      <h3>Zeerovers</h3>
      <p class="mainp1">
        My all-time favorite! It does not get much fresher than this. Zeerovers
        is a locally owned restaurant that serves fresh fish caught right from
        local waters. This is where the locals eat, which is always a good sign.
        The waiting line to order food can be quite long but believe me, it is
        worth the wait. Make sure to try some of the local papaya hot pepper
        sauce. Bon appetit!
      </p>

      <h3>Pika's Corner</h3>
      <p class="mainp1">
        Another locally owned restaurant with very yummy local dishes (and great
        prices!). Make sure to also pass by once for lunch, as their lunch menu
        is more extensive than their dinner menu. A dinner tip: the skewers!
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h3>Urataka Center</h3>
      <p class="mainp1">
        This local restaurant serves the best pizza on the island. Again, you
        will need to be a little patient as it gets busy with call in orders,
        but believe me, it is well worth the wait.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>The Old Cunucu House</h3>
      <p class="mainp1">
        A little pricier than the previous options, but a must-visit when
        vacationing on Aruba. The restaurant is located inside an original old
        Aruban cunucu (country) house, and serves local Aruban dishes. The home
        made sangria is to die for!

      <h3>Indo</h3>
      <p class="mainp1">
        This is the place to be if you are into Surinamese food. With the
        typical Surinamese decorations, you will find yourself in a different
        country for a littlebit. Try the roti, you will not be disappointed!

      <p class="mainp1">
        In 2013, I travelled to Aruba for a 5-month internship at the island's
        leading tour operator De Palm Tours. As soon as I stepped outside the
        airport, I felt at home. Ever since, the island has a special place in
        my heart and I still spend a large part of the year on the One Happy
        Island.
      </p>
      <p class="mainp1">
        As you can probably tell by taking a look at the other pages, I
        especially love hiking and exploring new areas of the island that even
        most locals do not know exist. My local friends often ask me to guide
        them around! I have been playing around with the idea of a website
        through which I can share my tips and secret spots, so that tourists can
        enjoy their vacation to the fullest, and go beyond the obvious tourist
        spots. I hope my page will inspire you to travel to Aruba, or give you
        some ideas for your vacation itinerary. Do you have any questions?
        Please do not hesitate to ask. I would love to help out!

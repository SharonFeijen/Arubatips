      Aruba's beaches are very versatile. Whether you want to have some fun in
      the sun and engage in some exciting water activities, or look for a quiet
      spot on a secluded beach; Aruba has it. Below, I have listed my favorites
      for you to enjoy.

          <h3>Rodgers Beach</h3>
          <p>
            There are no facilities on this beach. No lounge and palapa rentals.
            And honestly, that is exactly what I like about it. When I want a
            relaxing day on the beach with just me, myself and my cooler, I go
            here. On Sundays, many locals bring their families (and speakers, so
            skip Sundays if you want relaxation) for a nice Sunday BBQ. This
            beach is located right next to Baby Beach, so makes for a good
            combination of these two beaches.

          <h3>Arashi Beach</h3>
          <p>
            If you are looking for a beach where the locals go, this is the
            beach for you. Bring some cold beers and watch the kitesurfers show
            off their skills as the sun goes down.

          <h3>Tres Trapi</h3>
          <p>
            Crystalclear waters, palapas, turtles, fishes.. This beach will put
            you in full vacation mode! Make sure to arrive a bit early if you
            want some shade. Enjoy!
